# GPS Agile Development

In my faculty, BarcelonaTech (FIB), I did a subject called GPS in which we learned many things about **Agile Software Development** and **Test driven Development**.

Together with 6 mates mine, we did a project that was based on the simulation of a terminal point of a supermarket sells children's toys. For this to learn how the agile development, we made the project based on Test Driven Development and the famous method called **Scrum**. That is, as we were developing an increase in output, automatically were testing for that verification of its operation. We use files called "**features**" in which we were allowed to check easily.

As I said before, I did this project together with six university mates, which I leave then with their respective Linkedin profile (if they have it): [Gerard Casas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casassg), [Quim Motger](https://es.linkedin.com/in/joaquim-motger-de-la-encarnaci%C3%B3n-5aa764103/en), Pere Bergé, [Víctor Pérez](https://es.linkedin.com/in/v%C3%ADctor-p%C3%A9rez-500011109/en), David Morán and Arnau Miralles. And the teacher [Jordi Pradel](https://es.linkedin.com/in/jordipradel).

Thank you for your time and enjoy it!
